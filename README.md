# Introduction
Created a recommendation system by designing a simple algorithm, making use of reinforcement learning, as an FYP at NTU

# Training data:
Real-world taxi trip data provided by LTA. Consists of features such as vehicle id, start and end coordinates, duration and distance of trip, and more

# Overview:
## Data Preprocessing
  - Data cleaning and feature engineering
## Recommendation System
  - Supply-Demand gap prediction model
  - Dynamic Earning Calculator
      - Reverse engineering to obtain a certain parameter
      - Reinforcement Learning to implement a dynamic surge multiplier

# Results:
- A whole working day was simulated to obtain results, which were then compared against the training data
- The simulation was repeated with different starting locations and timings to ensure consistency in performance throughout the entire day, regardless of the starting location
- Improvements in earnings were noted, with percentage increases ranging from approximately 38% to 163%
